# PROJECT-FORM APP

* Create a form app using React JS . Display form inputs in preview section while filing the inputs and submit inputs and display in the modal box. Create two buttons in modal box: one for posting the data and another for canceling the post process.

* Modify your forms app, to GET notes from db.json
  - Make new component for listing posts
  - Rearrange your layout to have form on left, view input “notepad” and list of notes on right.
  - You can use fetch or axios for getting list from json file.

* Complete forms app to post your notes to local db.json and make sure it still display notes from your db.json file.
